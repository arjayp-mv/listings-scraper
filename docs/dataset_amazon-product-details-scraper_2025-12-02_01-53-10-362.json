The only one they had in stock was a Lithium Ion that cost $200 but he told me all the benefits to it and that it was worth the money (don't believe it). Rode it twice before moving and when I got here she wouldn't start. First it was a slow crank then NOTHING, no power at all, no lights. I got a lithium ion battery charger and it showed that the battery had a full charge. I spent the next couple of weeks (between unpacking and putting furniture together) looking for a blown fuse or disconnected wire. Nothing worked and I was preparing to send it to the shop again. Then my neighbor told me that he was told those lithium batteries are worthless, something about the microchip in them giving trouble. I did not think he was right so I decided to just get the least expensive battery I could find for my bike and see. When it arrived I hooked it up to the charger but within 30 seconds it said it was fully charged. I was worried that the battery may not fit because it is wider than the OEM one, but it fit perfectly without ANY issues. I connected the cable and she fired right up! This battery will fit a Yamaha V-Star 1100 without any problems and it works great!",

      "text": "This review is subject to change. I ordered the battery and it came as expected. Packaging was ok, and no physical damage to the battery. Since it claimed to be factory charged and activated, I put my snap-on battery tester on it to make sure it actually was and in good condition. Voltage showed 12.62VDC @ 194CCA, and it said replace battery. So I charged it overnight on a low and slow 2A charger. When I came back to recheck it, it said 13.42VDC @ 177CCA and again to replace battery. So during charging it lost cold cranking amps, indicating to me that this battery is likely just a refurbished job being sold as new. Price point was good though. But because of the low price point I decided I should check to ensure what I’m getting is as advertised. And it’s not. I’ve put in for a replacement, and will update with how that one turns out when it arrives. However, I do suspect this is a common occurrence since other reviews have said it will no longer keep a charge after a short period of time, which is exactly how this one would have performed if I installed it before checking it first. Update: 9/15/25 Ordered a replacement battery in exchange for the one I originally posted. I didn’t bother pulling this one all the way out of the box or getting all the plastic off it before testing it. This confirms my original theory. Tested as soon as I opened it. 12.62VDC @ 196CCA which is 54% capacity of CCA or cold cranking amps. Meaning, this battery is already failed. But don’t let me dissuade you. If you need a battery of this size just to get you through, say finishing out a mowing season for your mower and you don’t want to spend the money, this will work. However, this battery will not last. It will eventually fail within a couple weeks to months and will not take a charge any longer, leaving you to replace it again, especially if it’s going to sit for prolonged periods like a mower during the winter. This battery will get you by, but is not a long term solution. So purchase being fully aware of what you’re getting. If I’m being completely honest, the seller already knows this, and that’s why this battery is half the cost of a new name brand like Yuasa. For half the cost, you get half the capacity.",

I understand that these things can happen, but the vendor, Infinisia, is by far the worst seller I have ever dealt with. Trying to initiate an exchange or return through them is nearly impossible. The automated phone system tells you to press 3 for returns and then hangs up every single time. A full week of emails went unanswered. Thankfully, I escalated the issue through Amazon, and they handled it promptly by issuing a refund. I’m not upset that the battery failed, things break, but I am completely disappointed in this third-party seller. Never again.",

      "text": "I used to own motorcycles, but now, only cars. I still have knowledge from my motorcycle days. Most recent production cars require an aux battery due to the auto engine stop on idle eco feature. The list of usable batteries is not very openly documented. In fact auto manufacturers would prefer to deceive consumers only to buy their genuine battery for a much higher price. My car in question has a base tray size of ~3.5 inch by ~6 inch for the aux battery. Height for the original battery is 5.1 inch (more like a 10Ah size). However, any battery with the correct base size could work. Height is only relative when ample headroom is available. This particular battery (YTX14-BS, 12Ah) is well constructed with a very even weight distribution. Being sealed is great with no requirement for a breather tube. The whole battery block is finished well without any sharp edges. With this leak proof feature, it is even better suited for use as an Aux Battery for cars. It has a height of 5.9 inch so I had to lengthen the strap that secures the battery to accommodate the extra 0.8 inch height. When all is done, the battery sits securely and functions within specifications. The photo shows the original battery at 5.1 inch high. There is plenty of room to accommodate a 5.9 inch high battery. Lengthening the strap will do the trick.",
